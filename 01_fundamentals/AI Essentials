## Answers & Explanations

1. **Which choice best describes AI?**  
**✔️ Answer:** A machine’s ability to learn from experience, without explicit programming, to perform functions usually associated with the human mind.  
**Why:** AI systems learn patterns from data and perform human-like tasks (reasoning, perception, language).

2. **Which choice best explains machine learning (ML)?**  
**✔️ Answer:** A learning approach using algorithms that improve with exposure to more data over time.  
**Why:** Models generalize patterns from examples and get better as datasets grow.

3. **Which statement about deep learning (DL) is FALSE?**  
**✔️ Answer:** “DL is not well-suited for usages like computer vision or speech recognition.” (False)  
**Why:** DL excels exactly in vision and speech tasks with neural networks.

4. **Which statement about AI is TRUE?**  
**✔️ Answer:** Each AI problem demands a different solution based on data, solution requirements and cost/complexity.  
**Why:** There is no one-size-fits-all; solution design depends on constraints.

5. **AI approaches can be separated into THREE broad types of learning.**  
**✔️ Answer(s):** Supervised learning; Unsupervised learning; Reinforcement learning.  
**Why:** These are the canonical categories across ML practice.

6. **Robotic arm adapting to real-time conditions/materials — which learning?**  
**✔️ Answer:** Reinforcement learning.  
**Why:** RL learns actions through trial-and-error with feedback/reward signals.

7. **Unsupervised learning tactics used in ML (select all that apply):**  
**✔️ Answer:** Clustering.  
**Why:** Clustering groups unlabeled data by similarity. (Other choices listed are not core unsupervised tactics in this quiz context.)

8. **Unsupervised learning tactics used in deep learning (DL) (select all that apply):**  
**✔️ Answer(s):** Image processing; Recommender systems.  
**Why:** Autoencoding/representation learning can be applied without labels; recommenders often learn latent patterns from interactions.

9. **Why use K-means clustering with unlabeled data?**  
**✔️ Answer:** To extract insight for categorizing their customers in order to target advertising spending.  
**Why:** Classic use-case: customer segmentation from unlabeled behavioral data.

10. **What combination is driving innovation in reinforcement learning (RL)?**  
**✔️ Answer:** Combining RL algorithms with deep neural networks (“deep RL”).  
**Why:** Deep RL enables complex decision-making (e.g., AlphaGo, robotics).

11. **How was the Go supercomputer opponent trained?**  
**✔️ Answer:** With reinforcement learning, using trial and error to optimize reward.  
**Why:** The agent learns policies by self-play and reward signals.

12. **What is a “framework” in deep learning?**  
**✔️ Answer:** A programming environment with built-in libraries, functions, visualization tools, etc., to speed DL development.  
**Why:** Examples: TensorFlow, PyTorch.

13. **How many neural network “topologies” exist or are in development?**  
**✔️ Answer:** Thousands.  
**Why:** Numerous architectures/variations exist for different domains.

14. **What is a “container” in AI?**  
**✔️ Answer:** A pre-configured “AI-in-a-box” environment bundling libraries/frameworks/topologies.  
**Why:** E.g., Docker images that package dependencies for portability.

15. **How many open‑source AI “frameworks” exist or are in development?**  
**✔️ Answer:** Thousands.  
**Why:** The ecosystem includes a very large number beyond the major ones.

16. **Angela wants higher yields; variables include temp, humidity, pressure, purity — best approach?**  
**✔️ Answer:** Machine learning (unsupervised) to learn which variables correlate to yield.  
**Why:** Goal is discovering hidden correlations without labels.

17. **Seatbelt recall due to defects — best AI approach?**  
**✔️ Answer:** Deep learning (supervised) to identify defects.  
**Why:** Train a vision model on labeled images of good vs. defective parts.

18. **A trained network determining what object is shown in an unknown image is called…**  
**✔️ Answer:** Inferencing.  
**Why:** Inference = using a trained model to make predictions/classifications on new data.

## Reflection
- The most important idea: **choose the learning type based on the problem and data.**  
- RL is for **acting** via rewards; supervised is for **predicting with labels**; unsupervised is for **discovering structure** in unlabeled data.
