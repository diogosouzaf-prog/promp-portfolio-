# AI Inferencing for Predicting Overdue Bank Loans
Intel® AI Essentials — Course 2: The Intel® AI Value

## ✅ Correct Answers and Summary

### 1. Starting point for compute solution in the data center
**Answer:** Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors.

### 2. Financial service institutions finding success with AI and DL
**Answers:**
- Fraud monitoring, anomaly detection, anti-money laundering.
- Automated report generation (data sourcing, interpretation and analytics, narrative and semantic commentary).
- Risk assessment and compliance (price forecasting, credit valuation, loan and mortgage portfolio selection).
- Targeting products to their customers.
- **Video surveillance** (device, vehicle, people and behavior monitoring, such as facial detection or privacy masking). ✅ *Added correction*

### 3. "RNN" acronym
**Answer:** Recurrent Neural Network.

### 4. Behavior of a feed forward network
**Answer:** It feeds data straight through to the network, never touching any node twice, to be transformed to an output (such as image recognition).

### 5. Behavior of an RNN
**Answer:** There is a feedback loop connected to its past decisions; RNNs have “memory.”

### 6. Why the bank in PRC needed a high-efficiency AI model
**Answers:**
- The workload was too high, requiring manual screening of 10,000 loans monthly.  
- Efficiency was low (25 days/month for manual processing).  
- Manual prediction accuracy was low, causing them to fall behind competitors.

### 7. Description of an “ensemble model”
**Answer:** A supervised learning technique that combines multiple “weak” learners to produce a “strong” learner.

### 8. Ensemble learning groups
**Answer:** Sequential and parallel — exploiting either the dependence or independence between base learners, respectively.

### 9. Number of financial datasets used as starting point
**Answer:** **Three.** ✅ *Corrected from Five*

### 10. Role of the micro module
**Answer:** Generate risk patterns from clients’ loan and transaction behavior.

### 11. Role of the macro module
**Answer:** Generate risk patterns from market trends, such as stock market data, industry analysis reports, and business news.

### 12. AI technique mentioned to generate risk patterns
**Answer:** Natural Language Processing (NLP), to understand market segment trends from Chinese documents.

### 13. "LSTM" acronym
**Answer:** Long Short Term Memory.

### 14. AI performance improvement
**Answer:** The same 10,000 monthly predictions were completed in **two days** instead of 25.

### 15. Key takeaways from the course
**Answers:**
- Intel® Xeon® processors can solve complex problems by leveraging both ML and DL techniques, offering flexibility in designing ensemble models.  
- Ensemble methods like the one used in this bank case study can be replicated across the financial services industry.

## 🧩 Summary of Learning
This case study demonstrated how Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors and AI inferencing enable banks to accelerate complex workloads, reduce manual review time, and increase accuracy in loan risk predictions. Through ensemble learning, supervised models, and deep learning architectures (RNN, LSTM), financial institutions can automate compliance, risk assessment, and fraud monitoring efficiently.
