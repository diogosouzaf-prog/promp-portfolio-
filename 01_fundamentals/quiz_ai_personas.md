---

### 5️⃣ What do IT Solution Architects tend to care about the most?
✅ **Total cost of ownership (TCO), security, and manageability.**
> They prioritize infrastructure efficiency, security, and scalability.

---

### 6️⃣ What do IT Solution Architects generally do with regard to AI?
✅ **Work with AI developers to determine the best platform for AI scale deployments.**
> They design infrastructure strategies and integrations.

---

### 7️⃣ Why build relationships with IT System Architects?
✅ **To provide them with information to address demands from their AI developers and show why GPUs may not make sense for AI in many cases.**
> Architects influence technical decision-making and hardware choice.

---

### 8️⃣ What is one way customers can optimize their costs when deploying an AI solution?
✅ **Using their existing Intel® Xeon® processor infrastructure instead of Nvidia® GPUs.**
> Leveraging existing Intel CPUs saves money while maintaining reliability.

---

### 9️⃣ According to this course, there are three main types of AI Developers. What are they?
✅ **Library Developers, Data Scientists, and Application Developers.**
> They cover the full AI stack: frameworks, models, and applications.

---

### 🔟 What is the role of an AI Library Developer?
✅ **Develop and optimize APIs, libraries, and frameworks to support new algorithms and topologies on underlying hardware.**
> They make frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch run faster on Intel hardware.

---

### 11️⃣ What is the role of a Data Scientist?
✅ **Create AI-based algorithms or train AI models.**
> They turn data into predictive models and insights.

---

### 12️⃣ What is the role of an AI Application Developer?
✅ **Deploy solutions using AI-based algorithms.**
> They integrate trained models into real-world applications.

---

### 13️⃣ What do AI Developers care about the most?
✅ **Data, time to solution, and speed and ease in getting an AI model running and deployed.**
> Efficiency and scalability are top priorities for developers.

---

### 14️⃣ What is Intel doing with AI tools to help Library Developers get the most out of Intel’s AI hardware portfolio?
✅ **Offering a host of foundational building blocks, such as Intel® oneAPI Deep Neural Network Library (oneDNN), formerly known as Intel® MKL-DNN, for optimizing AI performance on Intel® Xeon® processor and other architectures.**
> oneDNN provides optimized deep learning primitives for Intel architectures.

---

### 15️⃣ What is Intel doing with AI tools to help Data Scientists get the most from Intel’s AI hardware portfolio?
✅ **Optimizing open-source libraries widely used for machine and deep learning to ensure major frameworks and topologies run well on Intel hardware.**
> Intel collaborates with the open-source ecosystem to enhance framework compatibility.

---

### 16️⃣ What is Intel doing with AI software to help AI Developers get the most from Intel’s AI hardware portfolio?
✅ **Offering several tools to optimize performance and accelerate time-to-solution, such as Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ Toolkit.**
> OpenVINO simplifies model optimization and deployment across Intel devices.

---

### 17️⃣ Why lead customer conversations with Intel's strengths when engaging with AI Developers?
✅ **Because the industry perception, primarily driven by Nvidia®, is that GPUs are required for AI training and inference, which is not accurate.**
> Intel demonstrates that optimized CPUs and VPUs can achieve excellent AI performance with lower total cost.
