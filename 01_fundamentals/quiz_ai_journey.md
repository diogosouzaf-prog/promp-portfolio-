## 🧩 Corrected Quiz Answers – Intel AI Journey

### 1️⃣ At Intel, we help guide customers in all phases of their AI journey. What are these four phases in the correct order?
✅ **Discover, Data, Model, Deploy**  
> This represents the logical AI development flow used by Intel: identifying opportunities, preparing data, building models, and deploying them.

---

### 2️⃣ The first step in the AI journey is the "Discover" phase. What happens in this step?
✅ **Identify potential AI opportunities, including 70+ Intel AI Builders solutions**  
✅ **Plan the organizational buy-in and build up the right talent**  
> The Discover phase focuses on opportunity mapping and capability planning.

---

### 3️⃣ Which main AI journey step is one of the biggest barriers to AI and is often overlooked?
✅ **Getting the DATA layer right**  
> Organizing, cleaning, and structuring data is often the hardest and most overlooked part of AI implementation.

---

### 4️⃣ Which three are popular data ingest software tools?
✅ **Kafka**  
✅ **Sqoop**  
✅ **MQTT**  
> These tools are widely used for moving and integrating large data streams.

---

### 5️⃣ When organizing the AI data layer, what four actions need to be taken with the data?
✅ **Ingest, store, prepare, and manage**  
> These steps ensure proper data collection, storage, preprocessing, and lifecycle management for AI use.

---

### 6️⃣ During which step of an AI journey will limitations based on the legacy CPU's performance potentially require the need for an accelerator?
✅ **When training the model**  
> Training deep learning models often requires more powerful GPUs or AI accelerators to handle computational loads efficiently.

---

### 7️⃣ Which statements are true regarding use of GPUs versus CPUs in deep learning AI solutions?
✅ **Most customers starting with AI do not have enough deep learning demand to justify a GPU's expense**  
✅ **Unlike a CPU, a GPU may sit idle most of the time, consuming capital, power, and space**  
✅ **Recent advancements mean CPUs can be used without GPUs, and are often more cost effective**  
> GPUs are powerful, but CPUs with AI optimizations can still be the best cost-effective choice for many tasks.

---

### 8️⃣ What helps bridge some gaps between CPUs and GPU accelerators for use in AI?
✅ **Intel’s strategy of continuing to extend CPU architecture with more AI enhancements and software optimizations**  
> Intel’s hybrid optimization reduces the gap by improving CPUs for AI workloads.

---

### 9️⃣ When a sufficiently high level of accuracy is first reached by a trained AI model, the model is:
✅ **Tested against a control data set to determine if accuracy meets the requirements**  
> Before deployment, models must be validated against unseen (test) data to confirm consistent performance.

---

### 🔟 When documenting information after a model has been sufficiently tested and ready for deployment, what are key things to capture?
✅ **The software code itself, the process, and any key learnings**  
> Proper documentation ensures reproducibility, auditability, and improvement for future models.

---

### 11️⃣ In the underwater drone scenario, what specialized software was used to implement AI in production?
✅ **Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ Toolkit, Intel® Movidius™ SDK, and Intel® Optimization for TensorFlow with oneDNN**  
> These Intel tools help deploy AI efficiently across devices and servers.

---

### 12️⃣ In the underwater drone scenario, what hardware was used to implement AI in production?
✅ **Intel® Xeon® processor-based servers with SSD storage in the data center**  
✅ **Intel® Movidius™ Vision Processing Units (VPUs) in the drones**  
> The drones use VPUs for edge inference, while Xeon servers process training and aggregation.

---

### 13️⃣ What does “continuous iterative improvement” mean in this course's AI case study?
✅ **Periodically re-training the AI model with newly ingested and processed data**  
> Continuous improvement ensures that models stay up-to-date with changing conditions.

---

### 14️⃣ What Intel partner enabling program can help when first embarking on an AI journey?
✅ **Intel® AI Builders program**  
> This program provides resources, partners, and frameworks to accelerate AI adoption.

---

### 15️⃣ For AI training, why is it more efficient to have a single data pipeline (CPU only) than a fragmented one?
✅ **Because data preparation and inference workloads, which make up the majority of time to solution, run well on CPU**  
> A unified data pipeline avoids fragmentation and simplifies workflow management.
